> [!WARNING]
> **ENVIRONMENT MISMATCH**
> This development environment is **NOT** Bazzite/Atomic. It is a standard Linux container.
> *   **DO NOT** run `bazzeye_setup.sh` or build scripts locally to "test" them. They rely on host-specific tools (rpm-ostree, ujust, SELinux policies) that differ from this environment.
> *   **ALWAYS** ask the user to test deployment scripts on their actual hardware.
> *   **DO NOT** trust local `systemctl` statuses for Bazzeye.
